title: Oceans and Continents - Know more about Mozambique
---

# Overview
Between Oceans and Continents brings together information on almost 14,000 enslaved Africans registered in Mozambique during the second half of the nineteenth century. These individuals were part of a larger effort by the Portuguese government to register all slaves living in its overseas possessions with the objective of gradually abolishing slavery in the empire. The website provides users with three resources. First, a database of the individuals registered containing their personal information along with that of their masters. Second, short essays about the history of the registration, the documents it produced, and the individuals involved in that process. Finally, a gallery of contemporary images providing visual context for the available information. These resources allow students and teachers to further understand the history of slavery and abolition in Africa, particularly in regions formerly under Portuguese colonial rule.
